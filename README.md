It will be devided in the following:
- Nodes
- Central server

## Nodes
Nodes will be used to read the environmental sensors and communicate the information to the central server. They will also be used to control several actuators to influence the enviroment.

## Central Server
The central server will be used to receive data from the the nodes and communicate the information to the the users and other nodes. The central server will decide which actions are required to keep the environmental parameters within the required numbers.

The server will also provide a local and remote platform to view and control the environmental parameters.
