# TM_2021-2022_Open-ECOsystem-Control_OECOC
Open source ecosystem controller for controlling: -Terrariums -Aquariums -Ponds -Greenhouses -Etc

It are be divided in the following:
- Nodes
- Central server

## Nodes
Nodes are be used to read the environmental sensors and communicate the information to the central server. They are also used to control several actuators to influence the environment.

## Central Server
The central server is used to receive data from the the nodes and communicate the information to the the users and other nodes. The central server decides which actions are required to keep the environmental parameters within the required numbers.

The server also provides a local and remote platform to view and control the environmental parameters.
